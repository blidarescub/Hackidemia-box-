The Grove - Gas Sensor module is useful for gas leakage detecting(in home and industry). It can detect LPG, i-butane, methane, alcohol, Hydrogen, smoke and so on. Measurements can be taken as soon as possible based on its fast response time. Also the sensitivity can be adjusted by the potentiometer.
We are going to read the values from the sensor and light up an LED if the gas concentration goes beyond the value we set. You can change the value in the code. Then, you can light a match or put the sensor in an area where there is some smoke and see the values change and also the LED will turn on.
